# CS408 - Web Dev - Final Project

## Project Spec
    For the overall idea of my project, I was thinking of doing a photography business. Where you could come in see different photographers, and their different price rates. The target audience is going to be the town, as well as like the people inside the town. Each photographer can come in and “apply”, (adding their name to the database), and then the people of the town can come in see the names, the prices, and the contact information from the database. 

    The data that the database will manage is who, the contact information, clients they have taken, and then the hourly rate. On the front as I said you can “apply” and upon clicking the button, a form will ask for your name, and rate. It will assume that you have taken zero clients.

    For each page we will have different things happening as well. The home page or index, which I have been calling the Landing page. Will be exactly that. Talk about the business what it does, as well as all of the different people inside of the database. This will auto populate when entering or refreshing the page, but there will be a button to also force refresh just the table as well. The reason why is incase you have two copies of the page open one wont update, but the other will, so you can force it too refresh to see the new changes.

    One page, the one I have labeled as PicturesTaken.html, will show some of the pictures that have been taken by at least three of the people in the database. I haven’t decided the names yet but they will be auto populated in the database and will automatically be put back into the database.

    One of the other pages, will be the custom search function through the database. The idea I have for this is you can search by price. One of the other stretch goals that I could have would be to improve the search function to include: Name and Clients, as well as allowing for a range detector.

    I have also decided that I am going to make custom CSS pages for every single one of my files, so we can view each of those inside of the CSS folder, and each file will also have the exact same footer, header, and div styles so there is a file for that as well.

    On the last page that I have set up for right now is a custom form page, this is where you can also apply but go into a bit more detail for your information; including your clients you have had. 

    One of my stretch goals, is to potentially add more information inside of the what database will manage, including like the base of operation per photographer, and then also maybe an edit button on the form page that I have started. I would love some other ideas though because, I am not sure what else really I could do. 

 

## Project Wireframe

TODO: Replace the wireframe below with you own design.

## Getting Started
    To get started, clone this repository, and then you can learn 
    to view it in the "Viewing" section. Which is below.

## Viewing
    I highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the project. This allows you to
    see the page, and interact with the page without having to open it in a local file.

    The file that you will be looking at for this project in my github is called "index.html"
