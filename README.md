# CS408 - Web Dev - Final Project


## Getting Started
    To get started, clone this repository, and then you can learn 
    to view it in the "Viewing" section. Which is below.

## Viewing
    I highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the project. This allows you to
    see the page, and interact with the page without having to open it in a local file.

    The file that you will be looking at for this project in my github is called "index.html"

## Testing

### Spec
    For the overall idea of my project, I was thinking of doing a photography business. 
    Where you could come in see different photographers, and their different price rates. 
    The target audience is going to be the town, as well as like the people inside the town. 
    Each photographer can come in and “apply”, (adding their name to the database), and 
    then the people of the town can come in see the names, the prices, and the contact 
    information from the database. 

    The data that the database will manage is who, the contact information, clients 
    they have taken, and then the hourly rate. On the front as I said you can “apply” 
    and upon clicking the button, a form will ask for your name, and rate. It will 
    assume that you have taken zero clients.

    For each page we will have different things happening as well. The home page or 
    index, which I have been calling the Landing page. Will be exactly that. Talk 
    about the business what it does, as well as all of the different people inside 
    of the database. This will auto populate when entering or refreshing the page, 
    but there will be a button to also force refresh just the table as well. The 
    reason why is incase you have two copies of the page open one wont update, 
    but the other will, so you can force it too refresh to see the new changes.

    One page, the one I have labeled as PicturesTaken.html, will show some of 
    the pictures that have been taken by at least three of the people in the 
    database. I haven’t decided the names yet but they will be auto populated 
    in the database and will automatically be put back into the database.

    One of the other pages, will be the custom search function through the 
    database. The idea I have for this is you can search by price. One of 
    the other stretch goals that I could have would be to improve the search 
    function to include: Name and Clients, as well as allowing for a range detector.

    I have also decided that I am going to make custom CSS pages for every 
    single one of my files, so we can view each of those inside of the CSS 
    folder, and each file will also have the exact same footer, header, and 
    div styles so there is a file for that as well.

    On the last page that I have set up for right now is a custom form page, 
    this is where you can also apply but go into a bit more detail for your 
    information; including your clients you have had. 

    One of my stretch goals, is to potentially add more information inside 
    of the what database will manage, including like the base of operation 
    per photographer, and then also maybe an edit button on the form page 
    that I have started. I would love some other ideas though because, I 
    am not sure what else really I could do. 
    
### Wireframe

    Below is the preview of my wireframe. It is more just for the first page then any of the others.
    I have no idea yet, on what I will be doing for those files.

## Project 1 CheckPoint
    All information for the Project one checkpoint will be found here

    1. 
        a) Below in the commits section will be all my github commits.

        b) Commits lay out a lot of what I did for this project this week. I did a ton of work that I count as prepping. I worked on getting things added that I will use but haven't just yet.
        
        I still need to add CSS and the different pages and their functions.

        c) I did not have any stumbling blocks that I encountered while working on this project this week. Which I think is a really good thing.

        d) My plan for the next coming weeks is to work a ton on css for two different pages, Image page, and then the forum submiting page. Which would complete them and then work on the other pages.

    2. At this current time I have no questions revolving my project nor my implementation because a lot of it is more of prep, than actual coding.

    3. I don't have any ideas for tests at this current time. I will next time though.

### Commits

**c626d9e76069cceda6ff52efa5fa72d24506d7fa** - This commit is adding the nav bar into each of my files. Including stating what file you are in. NO CSS was used.

**ce7dc9aff77f477276fbdd0491d72397cf529ccc** - This commit added seven photos into the file path img/top3/p1 for the project to use on all the pages of the project. I am unsure exact placements on images or if they will all be used (might remove later if an image is unused).

**a785b0f874bca26d3d7ed053bc4855df2b78b2c8** - This commit added eleven images into the file path img/top3/p2 for the project to use on all the pages of the project. I am unsure exact placements on images or if they will all be used (might remove later if an image is unused).

**519e28bce246ecb7cad5c63814a2fd859c243025** - Couple changes for this commit the first of which is adding the script into multiple places. (<link>) for index, formpage, and conditionalRetrieve. I then added the form template to both formpage and index. Then added the table to index as well. This is simply a template, because the code is exactly copied from my lab 11.2.

**772e8dd6f18218523e582cccd1461dfae2b712b1** - For this commit I grabbed the script that I used for the 11.2 Lab. I added them to the JS file and will be making modifications to it in the coming week to test it.

**8dff671a98e73b0661d9470f80122adefc736ef1** - This commit added eight images into the file path img/top3/p3 for the project to use on all the pages of the project. I am unsure exact placements on images or if they will all be used (might remove later if an image is unused).

**219c2c10bf94061aacc8183e2b6d9e3fd6a779c2** - This commit adds a majority of of the needed content to match my wireframe. However, this does not include the formatting to do so. The formating for this project has yet to be touched

**c26aec8b652c7116261f7a0ff9bd0150805778fe** - Fixing a few minor spelling things to make it so all class names that are set for individual html files are all capatilzed and ones for global CSS are undercase first then upper.

**61c6342c73ec0a16289021c933a890eedc5c7793** - Started the CSS by adding all the custom classes that I have made so far. No actual CSS was implemented for them.

**Final Readme Commit** - This commit documents exactly the changes that I made and all the comments etc for this checkpoint. We are also at this point so I don't have a commit number.

## Project 2 CheckPoint
    All information for the Project one checkpoint will be found here

    1. 
        a) Below in the commits section will be all my github commits.

        b) I feel like I did a lot this week, and I think I did decent describing inside of the commits below. However, what I still need to do is hookup the database and finish the last two pages. Which will take me a bit of extra time.

        c) The only stumbling block I had during this week, while I was working was getting the two pages I completed to be aligned in the middle like I wanted them too. I did get it though.

        d) FFinish my last two pages, and then finish the backend hookup to the database. That I think will be the hardest and take me the longest.

    2. At this current time I dont have any questions regarding my implementation that I would like others to answer. Thank you for looking at this though.

    3. I don't have anything that others can test at this current time. The data wont be sent but if you want to try the forum page you can enter information inside there. Upon submit it will send data to the database when I finish the function.
