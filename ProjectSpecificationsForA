# Requirements for A
## HTML & Pages
    You must have at least 4 different HTML pages, each performing distinct functionality.
    You can include as many extra pages as you wish — there is no limit.
    Every page must be styled with custom CSS.
    100% of your pages must get a perfect Lighthouse score for accessibility in Chrome (no exceptions).

## Forms & Data
    Your index.html must:
    - Be a landing page.
    - Contain a form that allows you to submit data to AWS.
    - Contain a button that retrieves ALL database entries and displays them on the page.
    - Include a way to delete entries.
    You must also have a separate page (not index.html) with a form that submits data to AWS.
    You must have a way to conditionally retrieve data and display it on a separate page — you can do this however you wish, but you cannot just return the entire database.
    All forms must properly sanitize user input.

## CSS & Styling
    You must have at least 21 CSS styles (21+).
    CSS should be distributed across pages (customized per page).

## Testing & Coverage
    You must have authored tests.
    Your tests must provide at least 80% code coverage of all your front-end JavaScript.

## Accessibility
    All pages must achieve a perfect Lighthouse accessibility score (100%)
